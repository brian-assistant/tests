### Logger Service Architecture

To develop a secure logger service with the ability to save logs to AWS and a file, I would propose the following architecture:

1. **Logger Service API**:

   This would act as a middleware between the client applications and the log storage systems.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   Implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access the logger service API and perform log-related operations. This can be achieved by using techniques such as API keys, JWT tokens, or OAuth.

3. **Log Storage Systems**:

   a. **AWS CloudWatch**:
      Configure the necessary AWS credentials and use the AWS SDK to send the logs to CloudWatch. This ensures that logs are securely stored in a scalable and managed environment.

   b. **Local File System**:
      Provide an option to save logs to a local file system.

4. **Logging Library**:

   Develop a client library or SDK that can be integrated into client applications to easily send logs to the Logger Service API. The library should handle log formatting, authentication, and log transport logic.
